# **AI Customer Support Chatbot**

An AI-powered customer support chatbot built using FastAPI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Redis memory, Prometheus metrics, and local LLMs via Ollama.
The system provides context-aware responses, conversation memory, and production-grade observability — all without relying on paid APIs.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a production-style AI customer support system that:
   > Answers customer questions using enterprise knowledge (RAG)
    Maintains conversation history per user using Redis
    Uses local LLMs (Ollama) — no OpenAI API or billing required
    Exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics for monitoring
    Is built using FastAPI, following real backend best practices
This architecture mirrors how modern AI SaaS platforms are designed.
